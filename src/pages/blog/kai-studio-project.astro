				<h1>My Studio Building Project</h1>
				<p class="intro-text">
					My architecture degree taught me how to think creatively and solve complex problems. I put those skills to the ultimate test when I decided to build my own studio from scratch in my garden.
				</p>

				<article>
					<p>
						In 2024, I began the journey of designing a studio to replace the old shed in my back garden. Drawing on my unique experience from architecture school, I created a detailed and creative design. I went through the process of gaining planning permission, which was an interesting challenge that I had some experience with from previous building projects.
					</p>
					<p>
						A big part of the project was resourcefulness. I ordered all the necessary materials, but I made a point of recycling and repurposing older materials wherever I could. This not only helped save on costs but also added a unique character and history to the building.

						With the help of my close friend Marcus, I built the studio from the ground up, bringing all its interesting features to life. The project was a physical manifestation of everything I've learned about design, problem-solving, and perseverance. It taught me invaluable lessons about taking a project from start to finish and seeing a vision become a reality through sheer hard work and patience.

					</div>
					<p>
						Building the studio was a perfect metaphor for education. Just as I had to carefully plan and construct the building, I approach teaching by helping students build a solid foundation of knowledge piece by piece. It reinforced my belief that with a clear vision, a bit of creativity, and a lot of dedication, any complex task is achievable. This is a mindset I strive to instill in every student I work with.
