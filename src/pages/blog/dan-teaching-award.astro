				A significant moment in my journey as an educator was receiving an award for exceptional teaching from the Thai Ministry of Education. It was a proud moment and a wonderful confirmation that I was truly on the right path.

						After two fulfilling years working for an EFL school in Chiang Mai, I was incredibly honoured to be nominated by the school for an award from the Thai Ministry of Education. It came as a wonderful surprise, and I was later selected for my dedication and passion for teaching. I've always believed in constantly improving, so I regularly sought advice from my peers and more experienced colleagues, and I spent a great deal of time preparing for lessons and trialling new techniques.

						To have this commitment recognised first by the school, and then by the Thai Ministry of Education when I was presented with the award, was truly special. It was a proud moment for me and felt like a powerful confirmation that I was genuinely on the right path in life. Seeing my efforts acknowledged in such a significant way made all the hard work feel incredibly worthwhile. This experience certainly fueled my passion further and reinforced my belief in the impact dedicated teaching can have.
