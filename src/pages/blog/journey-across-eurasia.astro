				<h1>Journey Across Eurasia</h1>
				<p class="intro-text">
					In an age where travel is often defined by direct flights, our team took a different path. This is the story of our 9-month overland journey from Southeast Asia back home to the UK, and the unexpected lessons we learned along the way.
				</p>

				<article>

						My good friend Marcus, who is half-Vietnamese, had always dreamed of taking a significant trip to Vietnam to connect with his roots and extended family. When I got married in Thailand in January 2025, it gave us the perfect excuse. Kai, another close friend, joined us, and from there, the three of us planned a long journey back to the UK over land—or as much as possible, as we navigated around conflict and dangerous areas by air.

						After the wedding, we split up to explore different parts of Southeast Asia: I stayed with my new wife in Thailand, Kai headed to Cambodia to visit Angkor Wat, and Marcus went to Vietnam. In March 2025, we met up again in Kolkata, India, and the real trip began. Throughout the entire journey, we continued our online tutoring, which often led to tutoring sessions with ever-changing and surprising backgrounds for our students.
					</p>
					<p>
						We spent two months immersing ourselves in India's incredible diversity. We visited the sacred ghats of Varanasi, where Kai and Marcus swam in the Ganges River. We marveled at the immense natural beauty of Hampi and the towering peaks of the Himalayas, and stood in awe of the magnificent architecture of the Taj Mahal and the Ellora Caves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our original plan to travel through Pakistan was scuppered when the border was closed due to escalating conflict. We also found it impossible to apply for visas for China from inside India, so we pivoted and flew to Uzbekistan. Here, we experienced a completely alien culture in the "Russosphere," where nobody spoke English and Google Translate became our best friend—a great lesson in communicating with patience and creativity.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, we made our way to Kazakhstan, where we hired a car for a five-day road trip. The landscape was breathtaking and constantly changing. We drove from cityscapes to Australian-style outback, then to sand dunes taller than cathedrals, a dusty mesa, and vast open plains filled with wild horses. We finally reached vast, deep canyons and alpine mountains, where we stayed in a traditional yurt.
					</p>

					<p>
						Our journey in Kazakhstan continued with a 2000-kilometer train ride from Almaty to Aktau. We stopped in the strange city of Turkistan, which seemed large enough for a million people but was eerily empty. We visited the Aral Sea, a poignant site that had long since dried up due to Soviet mismanagement. Our final stop was Aktau on the Black Sea, the oil capital of the Soviet Union.
					</p>
					<p>
						From Aktau, we flew to Georgia. The capital, Tbilisi, had a distinctly European vibe, and we felt a bit closer to home. We visited Borjomi, famous for its spring water, which we had been drinking in Kazakhstan. From there, we hiked around crumbling castles in rural Georgia before swimming in the Black Sea at Batumi.

					<p>
						We then crossed the border into Turkey. After a bus ride to the ancient, lost Armenian city of Ani, we camped there and were warmly welcomed by locals. They taught us to ride horses bareback, but with a friendly warning to bring guns next time due to the presence of wolves. From Erzurum, we were invited to sleep in a madrasah instead of a mosque, a testament to the kindness of strangers.
					</p>
					<p>
						Our adventure through Turkey continued to Gaziantep, where we visited Göbeklitepe, the oldest structure in the world—three times older than the pyramids and Stonehenge. We visited ancient towns full of preserved mosaics on the Euphrates River at Urfa and then camped in the mysterious fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, long since abandoned. We then reunited with one of my teaching colleagues from Thailand in Antalya before traveling to Istanbul to see the Hagia Sophia and the ancient cities of Troy and Ephesus.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, we took a boat to Athens to see the Acropolis. We then headed to Albania for a much-needed beach holiday before making our way across the rest of Europe and eventually back to the UK, concluding an unforgettable journey that has undoubtedly shaped our lives and our approach to teaching.
