				<!-- Section: Getting Started & The Sessions -->
				<h2 class="faq-heading">Getting Started & The Sessions</h2>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How do you match a tutor to my child?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>We believe the right tutor-student relationship is key to success. During our initial free consultation, we take the time to understand your child's specific academic needs, learning style, and personality. We then match them with a tutor from our team who has the right expertise and teaching approach to help them thrive.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>Are all tutors DBS checked?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Yes, absolutely. The safety of our students is our top priority. All of our tutors undergo an enhanced DBS check and are thoroughly interviewed as part of our rigorous vetting process.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How long is a typical tutoring session?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Our standard sessions are 60 minutes long. We find this provides enough time to review previous topics, tackle new concepts, and set goals for the next session without overwhelming the student. We can, however, discuss longer sessions for A-Level students or intensive revision if needed.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>Do you follow the specific curriculum my child is studying?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Absolutely. Our tutors are experienced with all major UK exam boards (e.g., AQA, Edexcel, OCR). We tailor the content of our sessions to align directly with the curriculum and specification your child is following in school to ensure our work is relevant and targeted towards their exams.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>Are sessions online or in-person?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>All of our tutoring sessions are conducted online via Google Meets, providing a flexible and effective learning environment that can be accessed from anywhere.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>What does my child need to prepare for a session?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>It’s helpful for students to come prepared with any recent schoolwork, homework they're struggling with, or specific topics they want to cover. For the first session, just bringing themselves and a willingness to learn is perfect!</p>
					</div>
				</details>

				<!-- Section: Pricing & Payments -->
				<h2 class="faq-heading">Pricing & Payments</h2>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How much do your sessions cost?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Our rates vary depending on the subject and academic level (e.g., GCSE, A-Level). Please get in touch for a detailed price list. We focus on providing high-value, expert tuition and are happy to discuss our pricing during a free, no-obligation consultation.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How is payment handled?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Payments are made by direct bank transfer for your convenience. To ensure smooth scheduling, payments must be made no later than 7 days after the session has taken place. We send out friendly reminders every Sunday for any outstanding payments.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>What is your cancellation policy?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>We understand that plans can change. If your child cannot attend a scheduled session, we will do our best to find a suitable alternative time, provided you give us at least 24 hours' notice.</p>
					</div>
				</details>

				<!-- Section: Progress & Communication -->
				<h2 class="faq-heading">Progress & Communication</h2>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How will I know if my child is making progress?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>We provide regular feedback to parents to keep you informed of your child's progress. After each session, the tutor makes notes on what was covered and any areas for improvement. We are always happy to schedule a brief chat to discuss progress in more detail.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>What happens if my child doesn't "click" with their tutor?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>While we take great care in our matching process, we understand that sometimes the chemistry isn't quite right. If for any reason you or your child feel the match isn't working, please let us know immediately. We will be happy to arrange a session with an alternative tutor at no extra charge.</p>
					</div>
				</details>

				<!-- Section: Technical Requirements -->
				<h2 class="faq-heading">Technical Requirements</h2>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>What equipment do we need for the online sessions?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>All your child needs is a computer or tablet with a stable internet connection, a webcam, and a microphone (most devices have these built-in). We use Google Meets which is browser-based, so no special software is required. We also recommend a quiet space where they can focus without distractions.</p>
