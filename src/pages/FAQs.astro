					<h2>Getting Started & The Sessions</h2>
				</div>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How do you match a tutor to my child?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>The right tutor-student relationship is where the magic happens. During our initial free consultation, we take the time to understand your child's specific academic needs, their unique learning style, and their personality. We then handpick a tutor from our team whose expertise and teaching approach are perfectly suited to help them thrive.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>Are all tutors DBS checked?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Yes, absolutely. The safety and well-being of our students is our highest priority. All of our tutors undergo an enhanced DBS check and are thoroughly interviewed as part of our rigorous vetting process, so you can have complete peace of mind.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How long is a typical tutoring session?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Our standard sessions are 60 minutes long. We find this provides the perfect amount of time to review previous topics, tackle new concepts, and set goals for the next session without overwhelming the student. We can, however, discuss longer sessions for A-Level students or intensive revision if needed.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>Do you follow my child's school curriculum?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>Absolutely. Our tutors are experienced with all major UK exam boards (e.g., AQA, Edexcel, OCR). We tailor our sessions to align directly with the curriculum and specification your child is following in school, ensuring our work is always relevant and targeted towards their exams.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>Are sessions online or in-person?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>All of our tutoring sessions are conducted online via Google Meets, providing a flexible, effective, and safe learning environment that can be accessed from the comfort of your home.</p>
					</div>

					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How is payment handled?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>For your convenience, payments are made by direct bank transfer. To ensure smooth scheduling, we ask that payments are made no later than 7 days after a session has taken place. We send out friendly reminders every Sunday for any outstanding payments.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>What is your cancellation policy?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>We know that family life is busy and plans can change. If your child cannot attend a scheduled session, we will do our best to find a suitable alternative time, provided you can give us at least 24 hours' notice.</p>

					<h2>Progress & Communication</h2>
				</div>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>How will I know if my child is making progress?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>We believe in a strong partnership with parents. You will receive regular feedback to keep you informed of your child's journey. After each session, the tutor makes notes on what was covered, celebrating successes and identifying areas for improvement. We are always happy to schedule a brief chat to discuss progress in more detail.</p>
					</div>
				</details>
				<details class="faq-item">
					<summary>What if my child doesn't "click" with their tutor?</summary>
					<div class="faq-answer">
						<p>This is a very important question. While we take great care in our matching process, we understand that sometimes the chemistry isn't quite right. If for any reason you or your child feel the match isn't working, please let us know immediately. Your child's comfort is paramount, and we will be happy to arrange a session with an alternative tutor at no extra charge.</p>
