			<h1>About New Leaf Academy</h1>

				<h2>Our Story</h2>
				<p>
					New Leaf Academy was founded by [Founder's Name] out of a personal experience with the challenges of the traditional education system. After seeing [briefly describe the problem, e.g., a bright student struggling to keep up in a large class, or the frustration of a one-size-fits-all curriculum], it became clear that a more personal, adaptive approach was needed. We started this academy to create a space where learning is not about memorization, but about understanding, and where every student's unique way of thinking is celebrated.

				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<p>
					Our mission is simple: to empower students to become confident, capable, and curious lifelong learners. We believe that the right support can transform a student's relationship with education, turning "I can't" into "I can." We are committed to providing high-quality, personalized tutoring that not only improves grades but also builds the self-esteem and resilience needed to succeed far beyond the classroom.
