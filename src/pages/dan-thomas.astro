					<h2>Our Founder's Journey</h2>
					<p>
						After achieving straight A's and A*'s at GCSE and A-Level, Dan accepted an unconditional offer to study at Nottingham University. He took a two-year break from his studies after his second year, combining work with backpacking to gain broader life experience.
					</p>
					<p>
						In 2022, his journey led him to Thailand, where he earned his TEFL certification and began teaching English. It was here that Dan discovered an intense passion for teaching. He dedicated himself to honing his skills, learning valuable techniques from experienced colleagues, relatives, and extensive online research into the latest, evidence-backed teaching methods. He also consulted with a relative who had written a world-famous book on teaching mathematics, gaining unique insights into the subject.
					</p>
					<p>
						Soon, he was teaching a combination of Mathematics, Science, and EFL in Thai international and bilingual schools. During this time, he resumed his studies in Mathematics and Physics remotely with the Open University, balancing his education with his teaching commitments.
					</p>
					<p>
						His dedication to his students in Thailand was recognized in 2023 when he received a certificate for exceptional teaching from the Thai Ministry of Education. That same year, Dan discovered the world of online tutoring and began to incorporate it alongside his studies and school teaching. He quickly realized the immense potential of online and digital resources, including AI, to deliver high-quality, engaging lessons. Seeing the huge impact he could have by helping students one-on-one, free from the restrictions of traditional classroom methods, he took the leap into full-time self-employed online tutoring.
					</p>
					<p>
						After witnessing his students' remarkable success in their GCSEs and A-Levels, Dan became committed to helping even more students achieve their potential. In 2025, he founded New Leaf Academy to turn that vision into a reality.
